			With the continuous development and advancement of AI
			throughout all forms of media, questions about it's
			implications and ethics are raised, one such way is
			through it's perception of people based on it's available
			databases of knowledge. This project aims to explore this
			biased perception of people, doing so through generating a
			self portrait of yourself made by Chat GPT's Dalle based off
			of a limited amout of inputed knowledge. The inputed information
			will come in the form of your answer to questions curated by us.
